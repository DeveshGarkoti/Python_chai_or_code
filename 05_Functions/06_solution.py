# Lamda Function
# A lambda function is a small anonymous function that can take any number of arguments, but can only
# have one expression. It is used to define small, one-time use functions.
# Syntax: lambda arguments : expression
# Example:

# square = lambda x: x * x
# print(square(5))  # Output: 25

cube = lambda x: x**3
print(cube(3))
